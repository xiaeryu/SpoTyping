#### 2016-06-22 (Important)
1. An option (--filter) has been added to deal with low quality sequence reads (reads with many 'N's and long homopolymers).
2. An option (--sorted) has been added to deal with sequence reads sorted to a reference genome (reads extracted from sorted bam file, for example).
3. A more automated mechanism has been implemented for hit threshold selection.
4. Changes on the output log file.
